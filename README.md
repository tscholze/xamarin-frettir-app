The solution is work in progress and not meant to be used from other persons than me. If you are looking for a perfect example to du something. Nope, that's not here.

## Idea behind
It is never to late to learn something new. 
Thats why I want to learn Xamarin, XAML and C#. As a trick to stay focused during the learning nights, I like to create example projects that could be used as a 'trainings area'. I test primarily on iOS.

## Prerequirements
- Visual Studio 2017 *or*
- Visual Studio for Mac

## Used packages
- Xamarin.Forms ([Github](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms))
- Xamarin.Essentials ([Github](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials))
- XF.Material ([Github](https://github.com/contrix09/XF-Material-Library))
- Newtonsoft.Json ([Github](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json))

(Sub packages are not listed.)
